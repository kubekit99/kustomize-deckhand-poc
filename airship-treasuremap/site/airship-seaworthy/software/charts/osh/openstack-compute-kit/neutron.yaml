# This file defines hardware-specific settings for neutron. If you use the same
# hardware profile as this environment, you should not need to change this file.
# Otherwise, you should review the settings here and adjust for your hardware.
# In particular:
# 1. logical network interface names
# 2. physical device mappigns
# TODO: Should move to global layer and become tied to the hardware profile
